Are you here to give us a grade? Yes? No? Does it really matter? If you want to download this application, you can clone the repository onto your own machine. Once you've done that, navigate into the 'code' directory and run 'make'. From there, it's as easy as running, './main.o'.

From there, we encourage you to calculate as much as you want.
